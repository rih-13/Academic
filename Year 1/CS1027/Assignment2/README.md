# Unlimited Squabble

## Description

The game gives unlimited chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. Each letter in a guess is labeled with respect to a mystery word as a correct letter, a used letter, or an unused letter. The guess can be a word of any length.

For instance, if the mystery word was “ADULT” and the guess was “AGENT”, then the labelling would be as follows: A correct, G unused, E unused, N unused, and T correct.

Letters are decorated/surrounded with either “-“, ”+”, or “!” which correspond to unused, used, and correct.

## Running the Program

Place all files in the same directory, compile them with javac and run the program by typing java WordLLExamples.

There are two modalities of the program. If in the main method of WordLLExamples you invoke method playEnglish, the program will play Squabble with words; if you invoke method playCards you will have to guess four Euchre cards.
