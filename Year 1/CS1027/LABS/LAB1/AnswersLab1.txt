Answers for Lab 1
-----------------------------------------------


PRE-LAB

1. What information is needed in a method's javadoc? What tags will you need to use?
It needs the purpose of the method, its parameters (f=if applicable), and return values (if applicable). Depending on the method, you will probably need to use the @param tag for any parameters, and the @return tag for any return values. 



EXERCISE 1

2. Why do we need to use the "this" keyword? What happens if we don't use it? 
We want to assign the value of the variables to the Player object's instance variables. Because they have the same name, it specifies that this is referring to the Player object's various attributes.



EXERCISE 2

3. Which of the lines in Step 11 do you expect to print out ("Same player" or "Different player")?
It should print "Different player" as we have not specified an equals method yet and they are different objects (stored in different places in memory).


EXERCISE 3

4. Which class contains the equals() method being called here? Is it calling itself?
The equals method being called here is not being called on a Player object but on a string, so it is not calling itself. It belongs to the String class.
